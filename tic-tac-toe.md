# Tic Tac Toe

Today, you must work on building this classic game of Xs and Os! Specifically, you'll be building a version that can be played *in a terminal*.

##### Base Mode User Stories:
* When the game begins, a user should:
  * see a representation of a blank tic-tac-toe board
  * be prompted to choose a space on the board
* After the user chooses a space to go:
  * the opponent (computer) chooses a space to go
* The game ends when:
  * there are no open spaces remaining
  * the user or computer has managed to achieve three-in-a-row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)

* Note: Base mode only needs to be a single round of gameplay where the user goes first.
