# Sevens Out

Today, you must work on building this classic dice game! Specifically, you'll be building a version that can be played *in a terminal*.

### The Rules of the Game:
* http://www.dice-play.com/Games/SevensOut.htm

### Base Mode User Stores:
* When the game begins, a user should be prompted to choose:
  * the number of players
  * the target total score that will be played to
* When a user's turn begins, they should:
  * see their current total score
  * see their current turn score
  * be prompted to roll the dice
* After rolling the dice, a user should:
  * see their turn and total score update based on the number that was rolled
    * rolling a seven is worth zero points and ends the current turn
    * rolling a pair is worth double (example: two fours would be worth 16)
* A game ends when a user reaches the target total score
