# game-dev-day-v1

#### Structure:
Each pod will be assigned one game to make. They must work 100% together on it. No dividing and conquering. Andrew calls it mob programming. The idea was to give students meaningful practice with collaborating to figure out and implement complex logic.

#### How to Get Students Started:
I showed them how these two files worked:
* `consoleInput.js` is an example that I used to teach students how to obtain user input in the terminal.
* `guessingGame.js` is an example of a basic game that I made.

#### Games for Students to Make:
These files provide the instructions for each group's project:
* `blackjack.md`
* `hangman.md`
* `sevens-out.md`
* `tic-tac-toe.md`
